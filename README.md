# Personal Portfolio (old)

Statically built portfolio. Built with HTML, CSS, and a few helpful JS libraries.

I really liked this portfolio and all of the implemented features, especially the skills bar on the About Me page, and the animations on the home/portfolio page. However, after trying out static site generators (namely Hugo, and trialing GatsbyJS), this website just couldn't compete with the speed of Hugo. My new "About Me" site is https://chrismorrison.ca, while my image editing portfolio has moved to my new company, https://mesmerdesign.ca.

Nevertheless, building this site has taught me so much about HTML, CSS, and JS. I intend to use these skills for all future web dev projects.
